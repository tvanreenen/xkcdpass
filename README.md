![xkcd #936: Password Strength](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

[Original comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) by Randall Munroe (xkcd, CC BY-NC 2.5).

`xkcdpass` is a small Go CLI that generates xkcd-style passphrases from the embedded EFF large wordlist using cryptographically secure randomness.

By default, it prints 4 random lowercase words concatenated with no separator, in the style of `correcthorsebatterystaple`.

The comic is a simple lesson in information theory: what feels obscure is not always hard to guess. Counterintuitive as it may seem, a few memorable words from a known list can be stronger than the convoluted strings typical password rules require.

## Installation

On supported published platforms, install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap tvanreenen/tap
brew install xkcdpass
```

Published Homebrew release artifacts are currently available for:

- macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin/arm64`)
- Linux x86_64 (`linux/amd64`), including typical x86_64 WSL environments

For other platforms, build from source locally:

- macOS Intel (`darwin/amd64`)
- Linux ARM64 (`linux/arm64`)
- Windows native

```sh
go build -o xkcdpass ./cmd/xkcdpass
```

## Usage

```sh
xkcdpass
xkcdpass --words 6
xkcdpass --separator -
xkcdpass --separator _
```

Sample output (default: no separator):

```text
washroomunquotedzebravelocity
```

Hyphenated (optional; easier to read or type):

```sh
xkcdpass --separator -
```

```text
washroom-unquoted-zebra-velocity
```

## Security model

- **Entropy source:** Go's `crypto/rand`, backed by the operating system CSPRNG—not `math/rand`, which is unsuitable for secrets.
- **Uniform words:** Each word is an independent, uniformly random draw from the full embedded list (the same word may appear more than once). Indices come from `crypto/rand.Int`, which avoids modulo bias you get when shrinking random bytes with `% len(list)` and the list length is not a power of two.
- **Flat phrase space:** No templates, grammatical rules, or frequency weighting—those steer output toward a smaller or more predictable set of phrases than uniform words from the whole list.
- **Formatting:** Lowercase words are fixed; an optional separator between words does not add entropy.

### Passphrase strength

The EFF large wordlist is public, so strength is quoted the way passphrase tools usually do: treat the list and the number of words as known, and measure what is left to guess—the specific sequence of words. Each independent uniform word adds about 12.9 bits (`log2(7776)`). For *n* words, that is *n* times as much altogether (`log2(7776^n)` bits).

Examples with the embedded 7,776-word list and a known word count:

- 4 words: about 51.7 bits
- 6 words: about 77.6 bits

Use `--words 6` for stronger real-world usage.
